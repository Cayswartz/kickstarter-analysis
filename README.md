## Overview of Project

Louise is a playwriter who wants to fundraise for a play named _Fever_. Not only is Louise a fanatastic playwriter but she has had an analytic savvy mind and wants to ensure she is using all the information available to help her play be successful. _Fever's_ budget is $10,000 and she wants to take a deeper dive into how similar campaigns performed specifically looking at what their funding goal was and what day they launched their campaign. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
When taking a closer look at launch date there is one month that stands above the rest and that month is May with the largest numver of successful campaigns while the failed campaigns stay in line with the number of failed campaign both the month prior and the month after. The months following May continue to perform higher well, though not as high as May itself. By August the number of approvals are back down to what they looked at prior to the May spike. Looking closely at failed campaigns we see a spike in October with 72 campaigns failures. Overall, I would suggest launching in May is possible. If this is not possible, the two months following May still saw higher success rates but whatever you do stay away from a October launch. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals



### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
